1
00:04:36,977 --> 00:04:39,645
又係依條友仔喺度攪事

2
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:46,152
依拳係為我阿爸而打嘅

3
00:04:46,153 --> 00:04:48,133
噢…散場嚕…

4
00:04:49,723 --> 00:04:51,259
依度發生咩事呀吓？

5
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:52,958
呀…阿 sir

6
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:55,062
頭先同你打交嗰個係咪雅蒙？

7
00:04:55,063 --> 00:04:56,063
係呀 阿 sir

8
00:04:57,831 --> 00:04:59,398
唔… 因乜事？

9
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:01,845
因為嗰條紅毛友囉
佢之前識嗰個畫家呀

10
00:05:01,846 --> 00:05:03,769
真係?

11
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:05,613
佢跌咗嘢呀 阿 sir

12
00:05:10,944 --> 00:05:12,511
我會攞入去

13
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:13,855
放鬆啦你 𠔊大哥

14
00:05:16,917 --> 00:05:19,158
又係你喺度搞亂檔？

15
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,099
你跌咗你封信喺外面呀

16
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,256
封信唔係我㗎

17
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:26,091
係 Vincent 嘅

18
00:05:26,092 --> 00:05:27,431
寄畀 廸奧梵高

19
00:05:27,432 --> 00:05:29,703
即係 Vincent 個細呀 係咪呀？

20
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:32,298
係呀 Vincent 留低依封信

21
00:05:32,299 --> 00:05:35,871
係佢之前個包租公 Geno 執嘢嗰陣揾到嘅

22
00:05:35,872 --> 00:05:38,145
跟住佢畀咗我阿爸

23
00:05:38,146 --> 00:05:40,039
而我阿爸話我要送依封信

24
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,007
搞到好似關我事咁

25
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:46,115
我係打鐵㗎
唔係郵差

26
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:54,157
你係唔自己嗌支㗎喎

27
00:05:54,158 --> 00:05:56,998
佢都唔要㗎啦，係咪？

28
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,838
我都唔明送封死咗嘅人嘅信為乜

29
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:11,971
你阿爸應該係覺得咁樣係一種尊重

30
00:06:11,972 --> 00:06:13,372
即係為乜唧？

31
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:16,208
由頭到尾嗰條友為我哋做過啲乜唧？

32
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:20,012
當年我阿爸唔肯簽嗰份請願書

33
00:06:20,013 --> 00:06:21,814
搞到啲人憎晒我哋成家人

34
00:06:21,815 --> 00:06:23,021
趕佢出依個鎮-

35
00:06:23,022 --> 00:06:24,583
- 我有簽呀！

36
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:27,319
我覺得要簽喎
嗰條友癲㗎

37
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,387
佢唔係呀

38
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,756
佢其實係個好有趣嘅人嚟㗎

39
00:06:30,757 --> 00:06:33,259
係佢個 friend 高更嚟咗之後

40
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,260
先搞到亂晒籠之嘛

41
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:42,441
Vincent 佢好積極咁想將間黃屋

42
00:06:42,442 --> 00:06:44,870
變成一間充滿畫家嘅酒店

43
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:47,907
跟住等高更做酒店嘅主人

44
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:49,512
張凳呢?

45
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:54,416
唔，好到極！

46
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:59,020
但當佢最後真係嚟到嗰陣

47
00:06:59,021 --> 00:07:03,455
佢哋好快就由好朋友變成敵人

49
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:37,423
唔得，唔得，你唔可以走㗎！

50
00:07:37,424 --> 00:07:38,724
唔得呀，你唔可以走㗎！

51
00:07:38,725 --> 00:07:40,960
冷靜啦 Vincent

52
00:08:08,021 --> 00:08:08,827
嘉碧…

53
00:08:08,828 --> 00:08:09,823
喂 Vincent 😙

54
00:08:09,824 --> 00:08:11,623
我帶咗份禮物畀你

55
00:08:11,624 --> 00:08:14,526
唔，你打交嚟呀?

56
00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:15,761
好好保存佢

57
00:08:15,762 --> 00:08:16,762
好嘢嚟喎好似

58
00:08:23,937 --> 00:08:26,008
你冇嘢呀呀?

59
00:08:29,309 --> 00:08:31,482
有趣嘅人?

60
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,714
我記得嘅唔係咁囉

61
00:08:48,995 --> 00:08:51,065
個癲佬切咗自己隻耳落嚟呀

62
00:08:51,066 --> 00:08:53,134
你阿爸係咪幫緊佢縫番上去呀?

63
00:08:53,135 --> 00:08:54,466
唔係呀，不過佢幫緊手

64
00:08:54,467 --> 00:08:56,913
嘿，即係一個又醉又癲嘅幫另一個又醉又癲嘅…

66
00:08:57,904 --> 00:08:58,974
講!

67
00:08:58,975 --> 00:09:00,007
你講多次！

68
00:09:17,257 --> 00:09:18,824
下個禮拜就審囉喎

69
00:09:18,825 --> 00:09:21,332
佢輸埋都應該冇乜嘢淨㗎嘞

71
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:23,397
嘿，千金散盡還復來…

72
00:09:23,398 --> 00:09:25,837
兩位先生晚安
有冇見過我個仔呀？

73
00:09:25,838 --> 00:09:29,004
呀，盧生, 有呀
你喺裏面揾到佢㗎嘞

74
00:09:29,005 --> 00:09:31,170
唉，佢應該搭緊火車去巴黎

75
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:34,118
嘿，佢睇落就似係邊到都唔想去嘞

77
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:36,275
唔，落吓點先啦

78
00:09:36,276 --> 00:09:37,576
唔，佢好似有啲麻煩

79
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:40,212
…佢自己攞嚟

81
00:09:40,213 --> 00:09:42,557
晚安呀 Joe

82
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:49,059
點解你唔直接寄去唧?

83
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:53,025
我有寄呀，寄唔到，打番回頭

84
00:09:53,026 --> 00:09:55,734
咁郵差都寄唔到，

85
00:09:55,735 --> 00:09:57,763
你又會覺得我寄到?

86
00:09:57,764 --> 00:10:00,365
我想你做盡啲呀阿仔

87
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:03,102
好似廸奧梵高依啲咁重要嘅人

88
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:04,470
你去到可以周圍問吓

89
00:10:04,471 --> 00:10:07,973
咁但係揾到佢嘅話我講乜好呢？

90
00:10:07,974 --> 00:10:12,244
傳統上首先你要講「折哀」

91
00:10:12,245 --> 00:10:14,313
你要醒醒先

92
00:10:14,314 --> 00:10:17,261
去唔到嘞，太夜嘞而家

93
00:10:28,595 --> 00:10:30,666
今晚 ok 喎

94
00:10:38,104 --> 00:10:39,845
You're lo convey
deepest condolences

95
00:10:39,846 --> 00:10:42,781
from myself, your
mother, and your brother.

96
00:10:42,782 --> 00:10:46,011
Oh, and don't forget
Little Marcel.

97
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:48,514
She was his friend too.

98
00:10:48,515 --> 00:10:51,316
She was 10 months old.

99
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:53,652
Babes are like animals son.

100
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:58,423
They can know the heart of a
man just by the size of 'em.

101
00:10:58,424 --> 00:11:00,259
No, they can't.

102
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:03,195
They're less fickle
than grown-ups.

103
00:11:03,196 --> 00:11:05,430
Just look at Geno.

104
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:08,139
He takes Vincent's money
with a smile for a whole year

105
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:11,003
and then signs a
petition condemning him.

106
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:14,439
Hey, mind you say that
Geno had the letter

107
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,141
for two years.

108
00:11:16,142 --> 00:11:17,951
I don't want Mr. Theo thinking
that we been sitting on it.

109
00:11:17,952 --> 00:11:19,980
Tell him how Geno
didn't even bother

110
00:11:19,981 --> 00:11:21,549
handing it over to
me until he heard

111
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:22,891
that Vincent had.

112
00:11:25,652 --> 00:11:27,853
Killed himself?

113
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:30,494
Why do you find that
so hard to believe?

114
00:11:30,495 --> 00:11:32,296
You saw what happened here.

115
00:11:32,297 --> 00:11:33,395
He had a breakdown.

116
00:11:33,396 --> 00:11:34,736
It Happens to people.

117
00:11:34,737 --> 00:11:36,172
If they're weak.

118
00:11:37,497 --> 00:11:39,568
Live longer, you'll see.

119
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:44,914
Life can even bring
down the strong.

120
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:52,678
After the ear, nobody would
even give him a chance.

121
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:55,647
Even kids were tormenting him.

122
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:57,059
Get out of here!

123
00:11:58,384 --> 00:11:59,556
Go on, get out of here!

124
00:12:09,996 --> 00:12:11,763
We are the kings.

125
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:14,433
I call it weak
letting kids chase him

126
00:12:14,434 --> 00:12:16,401
into the nuthouse.

127
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:20,509
And his neighbors, and
the police, and the mayor,

128
00:12:22,275 --> 00:12:23,845
and the whole town!

129
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:27,347
Against an ill man!

130
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:34,289
He even checked himself into
Saint Remy to get better

131
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:35,391
and so he did.

132
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,357
He got discharged cured.

133
00:12:38,358 --> 00:12:41,862
It doesn't mean he
stayed cured, does it?

134
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:50,035
I feel absolutely calm
and in a normal state.

135
00:12:50,036 --> 00:12:54,109
This is what he writes me
six weeks before he's dead.

136
00:12:55,475 --> 00:12:59,411
How does a man go from
being absolutely calm

137
00:12:59,412 --> 00:13:01,915
to being suicidal in six weeks?

138
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:07,094
It's sad, I get that.

139
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:12,960
But, what good will
delivering that letter do now?

140
00:13:14,093 --> 00:13:15,936
They were very close.

141
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:21,411
Vincent would write
his brother every day.

142
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:26,805
I know I'm the one who
collected the letters.

143
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,979
If it were me, I'd want it.

144
00:13:31,444 --> 00:13:34,846
If it was you, heavens
forbid, if you had died

145
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:37,482
and there was a letter out
there that you had sent to me,

146
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:38,483
I'd want it.

147
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:44,764
Wouldn't you want
it if it was me?

148
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,667
Whoa, lunatic!

149
00:14:58,197 --> 00:14:59,870
We could go to the Park.

150
00:14:59,871 --> 00:15:03,268
Yeah, but
It's probably still muddy.

151
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:05,408
I heard you were
Vincent's paint supplier.

152
00:15:05,409 --> 00:15:07,406
So I thought you
might know Theo.

153
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:09,174
We need a drink I think.

154
00:15:09,175 --> 00:15:10,342
It's brandy.

155
00:15:10,343 --> 00:15:11,576
Do take a seat.

156
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:12,954
He wasn't at the
address we've got.

157
00:15:12,955 --> 00:15:15,721
The guy there said
you might know.

158
00:15:17,183 --> 00:15:19,220
I'm afraid you'll
never deliver that Letter

159
00:15:19,221 --> 00:15:21,253
to Theo Van Gogh.

160
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:22,454
Oh, I see.

161
00:15:22,455 --> 00:15:23,559
Well how come?

162
00:15:25,391 --> 00:15:29,464
Two hearts, one mind
that's what Vincent told me.

163
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:35,434
Maybe that was
the case after all

164
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:38,303
because after Vincent
died, Theo went

165
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:40,071
into sharp decline.

166
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:42,941
Can I get you something my love?

167
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,443
He'd been poorly before,

168
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:47,220
but Vincent's death
destroyed him.

169
00:15:52,385 --> 00:15:54,331
He had actually been
with him a whole day

170
00:15:54,332 --> 00:15:58,123
at the end, but Vincent
insisted they use the time

171
00:15:58,124 --> 00:16:00,161
to discuss life not death.

172
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:07,736
And, no suicide note either,
so it stayed a mystery.

173
00:16:12,772 --> 00:16:15,252
And, Theo 'just keep asking why'?

174
00:16:18,444 --> 00:16:22,517
Six months after we buried
Vincent, Theo was dead loo.

175
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:26,160
Wow, the two of them.

176
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,830
So how did Vincent die?

177
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:37,362
He shot himself in
the fields above Auvers

178
00:16:37,363 --> 00:16:40,344
by his easel doing what he
loved painting to the end.

179
00:16:40,345 --> 00:16:41,867
Do you know why?

180
00:16:41,868 --> 00:16:42,868
No.

181
00:16:45,638 --> 00:16:49,176
Theo thought his unhappiness
went right back to childhood.

182
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:58,357
He tried so hard to
fit into his family.

183
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:07,030
But, he never succeeded in this.

184
00:17:12,565 --> 00:17:16,672
Vincent told me he was the
oldest but Not The first.

185
00:17:29,348 --> 00:17:34,185
There was another Vincent,
a stillborn older brother:.

186
00:17:34,186 --> 00:17:37,656
He thought that boy
was the perfect Vincent

187
00:17:37,657 --> 00:17:41,730
that he could never measure
up to in his mother's eyes.

188
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:55,848
He struggled to be what
they wanted him to be.

189
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:05,183
He joined his uncle's
art dealership

190
00:18:05,184 --> 00:18:07,752
and was thrown out in disgrace.

191
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:10,391
He tried for his father's
profession, the church,

192
00:18:10,392 --> 00:18:12,891
but the pastor exams
were too hard for him,

193
00:18:12,892 --> 00:18:16,127
so he took a job as
a lowly missionary.

194
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:18,802
He managed to get
sacked even from that.

195
00:18:18,803 --> 00:18:20,899
Yet another dead end.

196
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:32,582
But, Theo says he
believes in him

197
00:18:33,913 --> 00:18:37,248
and that if Vincent
will fight for himself,

198
00:18:37,249 --> 00:18:39,490
he will fight alongside him.

199
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:42,630
And, that was it.

200
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:47,661
Vincent picks up a brush
for the first time at 28,

201
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:55,437
and with Theo's support,
there is no stopping him.

202
00:19:04,276 --> 00:19:05,983
So what happened then?

203
00:19:05,984 --> 00:19:07,321
Paris happened.

204
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:10,794
He came here of course.

205
00:19:10,795 --> 00:19:11,850
They all do.

206
00:19:11,851 --> 00:19:13,451
Everyone does.

207
00:19:13,452 --> 00:19:17,822
Monet, Toulouse, Seingnac,
Bernard, Manet, everybody

208
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:22,193
because everything that
happens in art happens here.

209
00:19:22,194 --> 00:19:24,834
And, where do they
all buy their paints?

210
00:19:24,835 --> 00:19:26,776
Pare Tanguy's of course.

211
00:19:29,769 --> 00:19:31,269
Waitress a drink.

212
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,270
Make it pure.

213
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:34,317
Cheers.

214
00:19:34,318 --> 00:19:36,975
We'll see if it's pure.

215
00:19:36,976 --> 00:19:38,977
We'll keep that, thank you.

216
00:19:38,978 --> 00:19:40,779
Pure is purer.

217
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:43,693
We must Be fine,
to the buyer an ego

218
00:19:45,117 --> 00:19:47,485
like no other I grant you.

219
00:19:47,486 --> 00:19:49,821
But, a weekend painter.

220
00:19:49,822 --> 00:19:52,891
Look at him always drawing.

221
00:19:52,892 --> 00:19:55,694
What is it you were
saying on entry?

222
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:56,537
Which way up is it?

223
00:19:56,538 --> 00:19:58,029
Grow up Henri.

224
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,168
Lei me finish
it in a minute for him.

225
00:19:59,169 --> 00:20:01,076
Oh I forgot You can't.

226
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:04,836
You're being vile.

227
00:20:04,837 --> 00:20:07,539
The vile doth deny.

228
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:10,020
For many artists,
Paris is a final destination

229
00:20:10,021 --> 00:20:11,543
but not for him.

230
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:14,582
It was a stopover to learn
what he needed to learn,

231
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:17,882
and then he was off in
search of his own path.

232
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,317
You've done it.

233
00:20:19,318 --> 00:20:20,888
It Was in his sleep.

234
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:25,266
It's the kindest thing.

235
00:20:30,362 --> 00:20:33,531
I saw him once
more after two years.

236
00:20:33,532 --> 00:20:35,773
He was calmer, more assured.

237
00:20:37,203 --> 00:20:38,375
Take good care.

238
00:20:40,106 --> 00:20:45,009
And, I thought this is a man
whose story will end well.

239
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:48,583
His star finally rising,
his revolution won.

240
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:57,522
So think how shocking
it was to be standing

241
00:20:57,523 --> 00:21:00,970
over Vincent's coffin
just six weeks later.

242
00:21:02,962 --> 00:21:03,962
So sad.

243
00:21:07,233 --> 00:21:10,769
For many he died
a martyr for art,

244
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,570
but for me, it seems odd.

245
00:21:12,571 --> 00:21:13,872
Why?

246
00:21:13,873 --> 00:21:16,775
In only eight
years, he had traveled

247
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:20,883
from amateur to an artist
of influence, unbelievable.

248
00:21:23,382 --> 00:21:26,050
Monet declared him
the shining star

249
00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:28,725
of the Independent
Artist's Fair.

250
00:21:32,057 --> 00:21:36,161
And, he was cured
according to his doctor,

251
00:21:36,162 --> 00:21:40,269
Dr. Gachet who had looked
after Vincent in Auvers.

252
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,305
I met him at the funeral.

253
00:21:47,773 --> 00:21:51,414
There were just a few
artists from Paris and him.

254
00:21:53,946 --> 00:21:56,421
I could've thought he
was Vincent's brother.

255
00:21:56,422 --> 00:21:58,292
He was the one who
made the speech,

256
00:21:58,293 --> 00:22:00,952
and he cried all
the way through it.

257
00:22:00,953 --> 00:22:03,695
And, an hour later he was
running around taking Vincent's

258
00:22:03,696 --> 00:22:07,592
best paintings off the
wall as if they were his.

259
00:22:07,593 --> 00:22:11,268
And, they were, his fee,
for treating Vincent.

260
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:17,204
It seemed odd that the doctor
had Theo's full confidence.

261
00:22:20,272 --> 00:22:23,810
I understand he's still
close to the Van Gogh family.

262
00:22:23,811 --> 00:22:28,046
Maybe you should ask
him why Vincent did it.

263
00:22:28,047 --> 00:22:31,216
It's my father who
wanted to know why.

264
00:22:31,217 --> 00:22:34,892
I just wanted to deliver
this letter for him.

265
00:22:36,322 --> 00:22:39,667
The Van Gogh's are
only ghosts in Paris now.

266
00:22:41,994 --> 00:22:44,729
I'm afraid you're
going to have to take

267
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:48,837
this letter back to your
father with my condolences.

268
00:23:01,914 --> 00:23:04,724
Dear Father,
looks like I'm continuing

269
00:23:04,725 --> 00:23:06,417
my journey.

270
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:09,354
I need to find a new recipient
as unfortunately Theo

271
00:23:09,355 --> 00:23:10,355
is dead.

272
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:14,534
There is this doctor who
I believe is the person

273
00:23:14,535 --> 00:23:16,861
to entrust the letter lo.

274
00:23:16,862 --> 00:23:18,997
So, I'm going to Auvers.

275
00:23:18,998 --> 00:23:21,399
Make some excuse to my boss.

276
00:23:59,538 --> 00:24:01,139
Morning mam.

277
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:02,440
Yes.

278
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:04,387
I'm here
to see Dr. Gachel.

279
00:24:04,388 --> 00:24:05,610
Really?

280
00:24:05,611 --> 00:24:06,589
Do you happen to
have an appointment?

281
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:07,879
No.

282
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:11,149
I have a letter from
Vincent Van Gogh,

283
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:13,254
a friend of my
father's from home.

284
00:24:13,255 --> 00:24:14,255
Do you now?

285
00:24:15,921 --> 00:24:18,790
You know he's
actually passed away?

286
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:19,667
Yes.

287
00:24:19,668 --> 00:24:20,929
The doctor's in Paris.

288
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:22,906
He won't be back till tomorrow.

289
00:24:22,907 --> 00:24:25,897
I'll make sure the
doctor gets the letter.

290
00:24:25,898 --> 00:24:28,266
I'd rather deliver it in person.

291
00:24:28,267 --> 00:24:30,247
I want to ask the
doctor about Vincent.

292
00:24:30,248 --> 00:24:32,806
Well I can tell you about him.

293
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:35,340
He was evil.

294
00:24:36,408 --> 00:24:38,343
Is that a medical opinion?

295
00:24:38,344 --> 00:24:42,019
I could tell at first glance
it would end in trouble.

296
00:24:58,630 --> 00:24:59,470
He had these,

297
00:24:59,471 --> 00:25:00,307
Hello?

298
00:25:00,308 --> 00:25:01,499
Hello mam.

299
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,103
Bewildered eyes
in which there was

300
00:25:03,104 --> 00:25:06,606
something insane, something
which you dare not look.

301
00:25:06,607 --> 00:25:10,610
Just straight through at the
back in the garden actually.

302
00:25:27,126 --> 00:25:31,996
Well nothing has been the
same since he came here.

303
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:33,631
I'll get you a message.

304
00:25:33,632 --> 00:25:35,168
Tell me when it's convenient
for the doctor to see you

305
00:25:35,169 --> 00:25:36,510
where are you in residence?

306
00:25:36,511 --> 00:25:39,504
Where did Vincent reside?

307
00:25:39,505 --> 00:25:41,305
Oh at the Ravoux Inn.

308
00:25:41,306 --> 00:25:42,876
Well you can find me there.

309
00:25:42,877 --> 00:25:44,582
No, you don't
Want to stay there.

310
00:25:44,583 --> 00:25:45,843
It's a hole.

311
00:25:45,844 --> 00:25:48,546
Doctor booked him
somewhere proper.

312
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:51,549
But, probably suited
him better in a hole.

313
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:55,319
Well still that's
where you can send word.

314
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:58,990
You're not gonna stir
things up again are you?

315
00:25:58,991 --> 00:26:01,164
I've had quite enough
weeping over that nutcase

316
00:26:01,165 --> 00:26:02,527
in this household.

317
00:26:13,105 --> 00:26:15,779
(rain pattering}.

318
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:32,723
You looking for something?

319
00:26:32,724 --> 00:26:34,203
Looking for the owner.

320
00:26:34,204 --> 00:26:35,860
Speaking to her.

321
00:26:35,861 --> 00:26:37,795
You're the owner'?

322
00:26:37,796 --> 00:26:40,902
Well my parents are, but
they're visiting me auntie,

323
00:26:40,903 --> 00:26:45,203
so I guess for the next two
days I'm the proprietress.

324
00:26:45,204 --> 00:26:47,538
That's a fine dress.

325
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:50,041
Suitable attire
for a proprietress.

326
00:26:50,042 --> 00:26:52,079
I don't get lo
wear it that often

327
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,611
when my father's hers.

328
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:55,413
Always got errands for ma.

329
00:26:55,414 --> 00:26:57,281
Well that's life.

330
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:58,583
Fancy something?

331
00:26:58,584 --> 00:27:01,258
I won't say no to a hot coffee.

332
00:27:13,932 --> 00:27:16,234
So what brings you lo Auvers?

333
00:27:16,235 --> 00:27:19,470
A friend of my father's
Vincent Van Gogh.

334
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:22,907
We just found out
he killed himself.

335
00:27:22,908 --> 00:27:24,575
He stayed here.

336
00:27:24,576 --> 00:27:25,576
I know.

337
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:30,448
Were you here when it happened?

338
00:27:30,449 --> 00:27:32,122
It was so dreadful.

339
00:27:35,154 --> 00:27:37,955
I sewed the tenants
dinner at seven.

340
00:27:37,956 --> 00:27:40,324
And, he wasn't there.

341
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:41,998
He came later though.

342
00:27:45,097 --> 00:27:47,532
But, something was very wrong.

343
00:27:52,104 --> 00:27:53,139
Mr. Vincent?

344
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:54,446
Vincent, are you alright sir?

345
00:27:54,447 --> 00:27:57,443
My father went after him.

346
00:27:59,378 --> 00:28:00,645
Vincent?

347
00:28:00,646 --> 00:28:03,047
What's happened Vincent?

348
00:28:03,048 --> 00:28:04,322
Are you alright?

349
00:28:05,551 --> 00:28:06,551
Oh my God!

350
00:28:07,486 --> 00:28:09,387
What have you done?

351
00:28:09,388 --> 00:28:11,368
I tried to kill myself.

352
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:19,467
And Dr.
Gachet was called.

353
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:23,005
He didn't even say
one word to Vincent.

354
00:28:23,006 --> 00:28:25,208
The two of them just
looked at each other

355
00:28:25,209 --> 00:28:26,979
like two angry wolves.

356
00:28:30,475 --> 00:28:32,148
And, Vincent's lying on this bed

357
00:28:32,149 --> 00:28:33,815
and a bulletin his belly.

358
00:28:33,816 --> 00:28:36,152
He's crying out in pain
asking when someone

359
00:28:36,153 --> 00:28:39,527
would remove it, and Dr.
Gachet, an ex military doctor,

360
00:28:39,528 --> 00:28:42,753
I mean he should know
how to remove a bullet.

361
00:28:42,754 --> 00:28:44,388
He does nothing!

362
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:48,159
He just decided the case
was hopeless and left.

363
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:51,004
The next morning rumors
about Vincent had spread

364
00:28:51,005 --> 00:28:52,997
all over town.

365
00:28:52,998 --> 00:28:55,035
And, at eight o'clock,
Gendarme Rigaumon

366
00:28:55,036 --> 00:28:56,239
comes knocking.

367
00:28:58,170 --> 00:28:59,604
What are you doing?

368
00:28:59,605 --> 00:29:00,913
Can't you leave
the man in peace?

369
00:29:00,914 --> 00:29:02,611
Can't you see he's not Well?

370
00:29:02,612 --> 00:29:05,919
I'm just being thorough,
Mr. Ravoux, that's all.

371
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,185
Where's the gun?

372
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:10,448
No idea.

373
00:29:10,449 --> 00:29:11,682
No idea.

374
00:29:11,683 --> 00:29:14,619
My father sent him away.

375
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:16,463
He said Rigaumon
is the last person

376
00:29:16,464 --> 00:29:18,935
a dying man should have to see.

377
00:29:20,726 --> 00:29:23,701
Mr. Theo came in the
afternoon, and he comes in

378
00:29:23,702 --> 00:29:25,231
yelling, "What happened?

379
00:29:25,232 --> 00:29:26,864
"How?"

380
00:29:31,303 --> 00:29:35,410
That was the terrible thing
is that no one really knew.

381
00:29:38,243 --> 00:29:42,313
And, then, you know,
it was normal and calm.

382
00:29:42,314 --> 00:29:44,482
And, you know I honestly thought.

383
00:29:44,483 --> 00:29:46,617
It was all gonna lo he fine.

384
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:49,724
If only I could've
been one of them.

385
00:29:53,158 --> 00:29:57,228
But, as the
night came, a fever in him

386
00:29:57,229 --> 00:29:59,897
rose, and he was getting weaker.

387
00:30:58,056 --> 00:31:02,004
And, about half past one,
Theo comes downstairs.

388
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:11,041
And, we all knew
that is was over,

389
00:31:17,075 --> 00:31:18,748
and Vincent was dead.

390
00:31:37,863 --> 00:31:39,997
What do you think happened?

391
00:31:39,998 --> 00:31:41,832
Did you see it coming?

392
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:43,868
He was happy here.

393
00:31:43,869 --> 00:31:46,670
I honestly thought He was.

394
00:31:46,671 --> 00:31:50,708
You know Dr. Gachet tried to
gel him to say somewhere else?

395
00:31:50,709 --> 00:31:52,176
But, no.

396
00:31:52,177 --> 00:31:54,445
He liked our place.

397
00:31:54,446 --> 00:31:57,359
No, you're going
to ruin your dress.

398
00:31:58,517 --> 00:31:59,552
Well you're light.

399
00:31:59,553 --> 00:32:00,859
You'll get messy.

400
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:02,586
Do you want a room?

401
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:03,463
It depends on the cost?

402
00:32:03,464 --> 00:32:04,722
Come on you.

403
00:32:04,723 --> 00:32:07,024
How much is the room?

404
00:32:07,025 --> 00:32:09,794
It depends on the room.

405
00:32:09,795 --> 00:32:11,695
Another foreigner.

406
00:32:11,696 --> 00:32:15,232
He liked us, and we liked him.

407
00:32:15,233 --> 00:32:17,968
He was a nice, quiet man.

408
00:32:17,969 --> 00:32:19,036
Sure.

409
00:32:19,037 --> 00:32:20,448
What you didn't like him?

410
00:32:20,449 --> 00:32:22,039
It's not that I-

411
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,040
- He could do unusual things
because he was painting,

412
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:25,248
but otherwise he was normal.

413
00:32:26,745 --> 00:32:27,878
Unusual how?

414
00:32:29,448 --> 00:32:30,950
On his first day, I
remember because it was

415
00:32:30,951 --> 00:32:32,650
a day like today.

416
00:32:32,651 --> 00:32:36,758
This big storm broke, and
everyone's rushing for shelter.

417
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:39,990
And, I saw him.

418
00:32:39,991 --> 00:32:42,663
He's just standing there
in the rain, in his suit.

419
00:32:42,664 --> 00:32:45,574
And, I thought, you know,
must be first day excitement.

420
00:32:45,575 --> 00:32:48,135
But, no he was always like that.

421
00:32:49,768 --> 00:32:53,841
Always painting day in, day
out no matter what the weather.

422
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:58,848
I heard he was
close to the doctor.

423
00:32:58,849 --> 00:33:01,078
What Dr. Gachet?

424
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:02,752
No, I wouldn't have said that.

425
00:33:02,753 --> 00:33:05,449
He kept rather to himself.

426
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:08,085
He was definitely
close to his brother

427
00:33:08,086 --> 00:33:10,191
judging by the
amount of letters.

428
00:33:10,192 --> 00:33:12,523
I know my dad was his postman.

429
00:33:12,524 --> 00:33:13,628
So you know.

430
00:33:15,193 --> 00:33:17,605
I was wondering when he
slept painting all day,

431
00:33:17,606 --> 00:33:21,198
writing these long
letters, always reading

432
00:33:21,199 --> 00:33:22,473
these fat hooks.

433
00:33:24,636 --> 00:33:27,139
I guess you could say
he was well organized.

434
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:28,472
Vincent?

435
00:33:28,473 --> 00:33:32,009
Yeah, you could set
your watch by him.

436
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,647
Painting from eight until five.

437
00:33:33,648 --> 00:33:36,558
You'd think he was going
off to a regular job.

438
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:40,655
He went all over, Chaponval,
the fields, the woods,

439
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:43,854
the river.

440
00:33:44,623 --> 00:33:47,291
He really liked the river.

441
00:33:47,292 --> 00:33:48,626
Speak to the boatman,

442
00:33:48,627 --> 00:33:49,627
Watch your step.

443
00:33:49,628 --> 00:33:51,130
He'll tell you.

444
00:33:51,131 --> 00:33:52,296
Oh dear.

445
00:33:52,297 --> 00:33:53,367
I'm in.

446
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:56,036
Enjoy yourselves ladies.

447
00:33:56,037 --> 00:33:57,501
Thank you so much.

448
00:33:57,502 --> 00:33:58,502
Bye.

449
00:33:59,905 --> 00:34:03,541
Armand Roulin friend of
the late Vincent Van Gogh.

450
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:05,042
Pleasure.

451
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:08,145
I heard he liked to
hang around the river.

452
00:34:08,146 --> 00:34:09,680
Vincent, yeah.

453
00:34:09,681 --> 00:34:11,982
Yeah, he used to come down here.

454
00:34:11,983 --> 00:34:16,056
Even before dawn to catch
some special kind of light.

455
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:20,160
Now I don't know much
about light catching,

456
00:34:20,161 --> 00:34:22,729
but I know you can set your
eyes on a lot of life down here

457
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:24,728
if you catch my drift?

458
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:26,030
Good lo know.

459
00:34:26,031 --> 00:34:28,599
He didn't talk so much.

460
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:32,707
Mostly just sat around
watching, sometimes painting.

461
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,409
And, this one time
it was just us,

462
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:40,678
me fishing, him painting.

463
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:43,881
Now it wasn't as
peaceful as it sounds.

464
00:34:43,882 --> 00:34:46,226
He made all sorts of
noises while he painted

465
00:34:46,227 --> 00:34:48,252
puffing like a steam engine.

466
00:34:51,890 --> 00:34:54,894
And, then suddenly
it was all silent,

467
00:34:57,195 --> 00:35:00,397
and he looked so happy
that This dirty crow

468
00:35:00,398 --> 00:35:01,741
was coming close.

469
00:35:03,435 --> 00:35:08,072
He didn't seem to care that
it ran off with his lunch.

470
00:35:08,073 --> 00:35:12,576
And, I thought to myself
how lonely is this guy

471
00:35:12,577 --> 00:35:16,423
that even a thieving crow
brightens up his day?

472
00:35:23,622 --> 00:35:25,829
Later that summer, he would
hang around these rich boys

473
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:28,926
who threw big boating parties.

474
00:35:28,927 --> 00:35:32,997
They always came with girls,
unruly ones if you know

475
00:35:32,998 --> 00:35:33,840
what I mean?

476
00:35:33,841 --> 00:35:35,332
Hey!

477
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:36,773
Yeah we could
do with a bit of money.

478
00:35:37,077 --> 00:35:38,435
Well is it paid?

479
00:35:38,436 --> 00:35:39,176
Vincent seems shy around them.

480
00:35:39,177 --> 00:35:40,571
Come on.

481
00:35:40,572 --> 00:35:43,109
He never did have
much luck with women.

482
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:44,642
You think?

483
00:35:44,643 --> 00:35:47,845
And, then he comes here
with the Gachet girl.

484
00:35:47,846 --> 00:35:51,115
I saw her pretty in a
porcelain sort of way.

485
00:35:51,116 --> 00:35:53,687
That's her, a real quiet type.

486
00:35:54,953 --> 00:35:56,691
I've been working
in (his village

487
00:35:56,692 --> 00:35:58,426
since before the
Gachefs moved here,

488
00:35:58,427 --> 00:36:00,960
and I never got to
speak a word with her.

489
00:36:00,961 --> 00:36:05,032
Yet her and Vincent, they
were chatting in that way,

490
00:36:07,032 --> 00:36:09,203
you know, like speaking
to each other was

491
00:36:09,204 --> 00:36:10,543
the most exciting thing ever.

492
00:36:11,936 --> 00:36:13,877
All I could see
was just your foot.

493
00:36:13,878 --> 00:36:15,873
God knows what she saw in him.

494
00:36:17,308 --> 00:36:19,686
Must've been twice her
age, and next to her,

495
00:36:19,687 --> 00:36:21,879
he looked like a tramp.

496
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:25,315
What, you think there
was something going on?

497
00:36:25,316 --> 00:36:27,193
They said they
were here to paint,

498
00:36:27,194 --> 00:36:30,359
but they took a boat,
couples often do.

499
00:36:33,491 --> 00:36:36,160
But, I will tell you this.

500
00:36:36,161 --> 00:36:39,506
Vincent, he looked
like he was all right.

501
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:43,167
Then he comes here with
a girl who I reckon

502
00:36:43,168 --> 00:36:44,841
was out of his league,
and the next thing I hear

503
00:36:44,842 --> 00:36:46,406
he's killed himself.

504
00:36:48,339 --> 00:36:50,874
Maybe you should talk to her.

505
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:54,244
I'm not sure their
housekeeper would let me.

506
00:36:54,245 --> 00:36:55,245
That one.

507
00:36:57,348 --> 00:36:59,850
Spends her afternoons
at the church.

508
00:36:59,851 --> 00:37:01,922
She's some kind of warden there.

509
00:37:01,923 --> 00:37:04,093
She certainly wards me off.

510
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:11,895
Here you must be thirsty.

511
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:13,230
On the house.

512
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:14,698
How nice you are?

513
00:37:14,699 --> 00:37:16,400
Won't your dad mind?

514
00:37:16,401 --> 00:37:18,068
He's not here to mind.

515
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:20,413
I'll tell you what
I'll have this one

516
00:37:20,414 --> 00:37:22,851
if you let me buy one for you.

517
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:34,218
I was wondering were Vincent
and Marguerite friends?

518
00:37:34,219 --> 00:37:36,255
The boatman said
they were friendly.

519
00:37:36,256 --> 00:37:38,131
Well that would
explain why she takes

520
00:37:38,132 --> 00:37:40,257
flowers to his grave everyday.

521
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:41,635
Oh, and it might explain
that big argument

522
00:37:41,636 --> 00:37:43,694
between him and the doctor.

523
00:37:43,695 --> 00:37:45,028
What argument?

524
00:37:45,029 --> 00:37:46,440
More than one person
saw Vincent leave

525
00:37:46,441 --> 00:37:48,304
the doctor's place
slamming the gale so hard

526
00:37:48,305 --> 00:37:50,575
it's a wonder it didn't
come off its hinges.

527
00:37:50,576 --> 00:37:53,570
But, the housekeeper,
she was going round

528
00:37:53,571 --> 00:37:55,072
saying that Dr. Gachel
had stopped Vincent

529
00:37:55,073 --> 00:37:57,274
from seeing his daughter.

530
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:59,118
Dr. Gachel is crazy
protective over his daughter.

531
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:02,312
He doesn't want her talking,
where are you going?

532
00:38:02,313 --> 00:38:03,313
To church.

533
00:38:14,626 --> 00:38:15,626
God bless.

534
00:38:17,228 --> 00:38:21,301
Oh glad to see you're honoring
God, not like your friend.

535
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:25,074
My father's friend.

536
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:30,747
You know Vincent actually
did his ungodly act

537
00:38:30,748 --> 00:38:31,748
on a Sunday?

538
00:38:33,511 --> 00:38:35,646
That's not the half of it.

539
00:38:35,647 --> 00:38:37,183
I saw him that Day.

540
00:38:38,616 --> 00:38:40,687
I was on my way to church.

541
00:38:42,487 --> 00:38:45,756
Laughing and joking with
those Sacretain boys,

542
00:38:45,757 --> 00:38:49,293
drinking they were
laughing at God,

543
00:38:49,294 --> 00:38:53,330
knowing what he was going
to be doing on God's day.

544
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:56,273
When I think what he put
the poor doctor through,

545
00:38:56,274 --> 00:38:58,708
marching in with his brother
like they were royally,

546
00:38:58,709 --> 00:39:01,943
like it was his garden,
like they were his guests.

547
00:39:01,944 --> 00:39:04,608
Well his brother might
have been dressed smart,

548
00:39:04,609 --> 00:39:06,111
but it looked like
he'd dropped down dead

549
00:39:06,112 --> 00:39:08,215
before he made it to table.

550
00:39:09,781 --> 00:39:13,695
I could see the fever in
his eyes at first glance.

551
00:39:17,488 --> 00:39:21,561
And, the great artist himself,
always skulking about,

552
00:39:24,629 --> 00:39:28,665
gobbling our food, just
making messes in corners.

553
00:39:30,044 --> 00:39:33,243
Oh well, mustn't keep
our Lord wailing.

554
00:40:05,536 --> 00:40:09,609
I wondered how long it
would take you to come back.

555
00:40:19,183 --> 00:40:21,185
He painted you didn't he?

556
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:30,430
So why are you here?

557
00:40:31,529 --> 00:40:33,099
Where else would I be?

558
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:35,441
Oh, I don't know let's see.

559
00:40:37,535 --> 00:40:41,605
Sailing around the
world, catching a thief,

560
00:40:41,606 --> 00:40:43,108
chatting up a pretty girl.

561
00:40:43,109 --> 00:40:46,782
Because I want to do
something for Vincent.

562
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:52,719
I'm sure there's a
lot you can do for him

563
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,219
now that he's dead.

564
00:40:55,753 --> 00:40:58,661
I heard you take flowers
to his grave everyday.

565
00:40:58,662 --> 00:41:00,829
Isn't that doing
something for Vincent

566
00:41:00,830 --> 00:41:02,592
even though he's dead?

567
00:41:02,593 --> 00:41:03,593
Oh that.

568
00:41:05,229 --> 00:41:08,131
I just do that out of respect.

569
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:10,167
He was a great artist.

570
00:41:10,168 --> 00:41:11,501
He liked flowers.

571
00:41:11,502 --> 00:41:14,571
Still seems real nice of you.

572
00:41:14,572 --> 00:41:16,643
You must've been friendly.

573
00:41:18,009 --> 00:41:20,010
I wouldn't say so.

574
00:41:20,011 --> 00:41:21,581
He was here to see father.

575
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:32,656
He was his doctor, and
he became his friend.

576
00:41:32,657 --> 00:41:34,136
It's hardly surprising.

577
00:41:34,137 --> 00:41:35,792
They were both artists.

578
00:41:35,793 --> 00:41:37,794
They liked the same painters.

579
00:41:37,795 --> 00:41:39,934
They understood each other.

580
00:41:41,132 --> 00:41:42,634
When father invited
Vincent's brother

581
00:41:42,635 --> 00:41:44,940
and their family for
Sunday lunch, Vincent joked

582
00:41:44,941 --> 00:41:47,280
about my father was
the third brother.

583
00:41:47,281 --> 00:41:48,682
Cheers everyone.

584
00:41:51,009 --> 00:41:54,183
So you were like
one big family than?

585
00:41:57,115 --> 00:41:59,356
He painted here sometimes.

586
00:42:00,818 --> 00:42:03,162
It was part of the treatment
my father recommended.

587
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:20,170
But, we didn't socialize.

588
00:42:20,171 --> 00:42:21,241
So when you went to the river,

589
00:42:21,242 --> 00:42:23,573
that wasn't socializing?

590
00:42:23,574 --> 00:42:25,008
The river?

591
00:42:25,009 --> 00:42:26,750
The boatman says you
took a boat together,

592
00:42:26,751 --> 00:42:29,246
said it looked like you
knew each other pretty well.

593
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:30,920
Well people think they
see all sorts of things

594
00:42:30,921 --> 00:42:32,189
in this village.

595
00:42:33,151 --> 00:42:34,892
Must've been some other girl.

596
00:42:34,893 --> 00:42:37,320
Hold you I barely knew him.

597
00:42:37,321 --> 00:42:39,823
It was father he was here for.

598
00:42:39,824 --> 00:42:41,064
They were like minds.

599
00:42:41,065 --> 00:42:42,993
They agreed on everything.

600
00:42:42,994 --> 00:42:44,564
Everything really?

601
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:49,332
Ravoux girl said Vincent
and Dr. Gachet argued.

602
00:42:49,333 --> 00:42:52,102
My you really have
been slumming it.

603
00:42:52,103 --> 00:42:54,004
I don't care for village gossip.

604
00:42:54,005 --> 00:42:56,006
She said people saw
Vincent storming out of here

605
00:42:56,007 --> 00:42:58,715
not long before his death,
and your dad was running

606
00:42:58,716 --> 00:42:59,743
after him.

607
00:42:59,744 --> 00:43:00,744
So what?

608
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:04,219
You think there was some
argument with my father

609
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:06,950
and that's why Vincent is dead?

610
00:43:06,951 --> 00:43:09,363
You think it's my
father's fault do you?

611
00:43:09,364 --> 00:43:10,887
I didn't say that.

612
00:43:10,888 --> 00:43:14,461
I think it would be
best if you leave now.

613
00:43:25,636 --> 00:43:26,636
Good day.

614
00:43:40,551 --> 00:43:42,552
Thank you.

615
00:43:42,553 --> 00:43:43,461
Busy night?

616
00:43:43,462 --> 00:43:44,296
Not really.

617
00:43:44,297 --> 00:43:45,822
There's your cheese.

618
00:43:45,823 --> 00:43:47,063
And how is your father, Adeline?

619
00:43:47,064 --> 00:43:48,560
He's well, thank you.

620
00:43:48,561 --> 00:43:49,993
Can I get you anything else?

621
00:43:49,994 --> 00:43:50,766
No, I'm fine thank you.

622
00:43:50,767 --> 00:43:51,603
Thank you, no.

623
00:43:51,604 --> 00:43:53,063
Good.

624
00:43:53,064 --> 00:43:55,100
Just busy enough not
to have to speak to me?

625
00:43:55,101 --> 00:43:56,733
Well if I did sit
down for a drink,

626
00:43:56,734 --> 00:43:58,111
I'd be wondering when
you'd be getting up

627
00:43:58,112 --> 00:44:01,276
and running off
somewhere more important.

628
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:03,842
Funny thing that.

629
00:44:06,844 --> 00:44:09,120
You actually gave me an idea.

630
00:44:10,348 --> 00:44:13,016
The idea to confront
Marguerite Gachet.

631
00:44:13,017 --> 00:44:15,756
Oh so you ran off lo be
with the lady of the manor?

632
00:44:15,757 --> 00:44:17,357
How did that work out for you?

633
00:44:17,358 --> 00:44:20,123
She told me she
didn't know Vincent.

634
00:44:20,124 --> 00:44:24,361
Hadn't barely exchanged a
few formal words with him.

635
00:44:24,362 --> 00:44:28,665
I told you you can't believe
a word the Gachefs say.

636
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:31,434
I remember when
Vincent moved in.

637
00:44:31,435 --> 00:44:34,973
People were asking him if
he was a relative of Gachet.

638
00:44:34,974 --> 00:44:38,775
Maybe they were
similar on the outside.

639
00:44:40,478 --> 00:44:41,786
This is incredible.

640
00:44:41,787 --> 00:44:43,780
They had the same red hair,

641
00:44:43,781 --> 00:44:45,818
and that same sad
look in his eyes.

642
00:44:45,819 --> 00:44:48,660
I've never seen
anything like it.

643
00:44:50,321 --> 00:44:53,530
But, on the inside,
they were chalk and cheese.

644
00:45:18,416 --> 00:45:21,351
Vincent wasn't
snobbish like Gachet.

645
00:45:21,352 --> 00:45:23,764
He was really polite and kind.

646
00:45:24,989 --> 00:45:26,900
Well hello, Jeuxmaine.

647
00:45:31,596 --> 00:45:33,196
Up you go.

648
00:45:33,197 --> 00:45:36,099
So what shall we draw tonight?

649
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:37,338
A chicken please.

650
00:45:37,339 --> 00:45:38,575
I might be seeing something.

651
00:45:38,576 --> 00:45:39,912
Okay a chicken.

652
00:45:40,871 --> 00:45:42,672
Skinny legs like you.

653
00:45:42,673 --> 00:45:43,945
Floppy tail please.

654
00:45:43,946 --> 00:45:44,851
Jomaine what are

655
00:45:44,852 --> 00:45:47,110
you doing out of bed?

656
00:45:47,111 --> 00:45:49,012
She's no trouble.

657
00:45:49,013 --> 00:45:50,686
Come on off to bed with you.

658
00:45:50,687 --> 00:45:52,449
She's no trouble.

659
00:45:52,450 --> 00:45:55,454
I want my chicken back.

660
00:45:57,722 --> 00:46:00,624
Marguerite said the
brother came here.

661
00:46:00,625 --> 00:46:02,692
Did you meet him?

662
00:46:02,693 --> 00:46:06,402
No, I heard he came
at Gachefs invitation.

663
00:46:07,932 --> 00:46:11,070
Vincent was always saying
that they might come here.

664
00:46:11,071 --> 00:46:14,049
Always checking if we
had rooms at weekends,

665
00:46:14,050 --> 00:46:16,039
but they never did come.

666
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:18,211
So did Vincent visit them ever?

667
00:46:18,212 --> 00:46:20,881
No, you know he'd
spend hours on hours

668
00:46:20,882 --> 00:46:22,481
writing those letters
to his brother

669
00:46:22,482 --> 00:46:25,086
when he could've just
hopped on a train.

670
00:46:25,087 --> 00:46:27,150
Oh no, he did go once.

671
00:46:27,151 --> 00:46:30,720
He said his brother's
baby was ill.

672
00:46:30,721 --> 00:46:33,167
But, I don't think the
visit went that well.

673
00:46:33,168 --> 00:46:34,591
. Why not?

674
00:46:34,592 --> 00:46:36,493
The lea towels.

675
00:46:36,494 --> 00:46:38,906
He said that canvasses
were too expensive.

676
00:46:38,907 --> 00:46:40,130
More.

677
00:46:40,131 --> 00:46:40,939
And so now he's only gonna paint

678
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:42,265
on these old rags.

679
00:46:46,003 --> 00:46:47,607
He painted some pretty
flowers, but I don't think

680
00:46:47,608 --> 00:46:50,173
my father was that pleased.

681
00:46:52,143 --> 00:46:54,817
What has the brother
got to do with lea towels?

682
00:46:54,818 --> 00:46:57,452
I reckon they argued over money

683
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:05,422
because it was the
brother that bought

684
00:47:05,423 --> 00:47:08,658
all Vincent's painting things.

685
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:12,362
I know because of the
last letter Vincent sent.

686
00:47:12,363 --> 00:47:13,501
Adeline wait.

687
00:47:15,132 --> 00:47:17,976
The day before
he killed himself.

688
00:47:20,004 --> 00:47:22,209
When he handed it to me,
he said it was urgent.

689
00:47:22,210 --> 00:47:24,878
And, you know I asked if
there was anything wrong.

690
00:47:24,879 --> 00:47:26,945
And, he said he'd run out
of paints and he placed

691
00:47:26,946 --> 00:47:29,356
a big order for some
more 'cause he had lots

692
00:47:29,357 --> 00:47:31,181
of paintings planned.

693
00:47:31,182 --> 00:47:33,286
Don't you think
that's odd to place

694
00:47:33,287 --> 00:47:36,128
an order with his brother
ii money was an issue

695
00:47:36,129 --> 00:47:39,956
between them and then to
kill himself the next day?

696
00:47:39,957 --> 00:47:43,193
It depends, you know,
on how balanced he was.

697
00:47:43,194 --> 00:47:45,128
All seemed fine with him.

698
00:47:45,129 --> 00:47:48,832
I mean something must've
happened pretty suddenly

699
00:47:48,833 --> 00:47:51,134
for him to become unbalanced.

700
00:47:51,135 --> 00:47:52,502
Like what?

701
00:47:52,503 --> 00:47:54,744
I don't know exactly what.

702
00:47:56,073 --> 00:47:59,709
I'm sure it's got something
to do with Gachet.

703
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:03,480
Do you remember his first
day that I told you about?

704
00:48:03,481 --> 00:48:05,392
This letter's from then.

705
00:48:07,084 --> 00:48:09,424
No, I can't Read
someone else's letter.

706
00:48:09,425 --> 00:48:12,159
If it's open, it's all right.

707
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:14,090
My dad's
posted me up some money.

708
00:48:14,091 --> 00:48:15,558
I'll open a tab for you,

709
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:16,765
and you can settle up
when your money arrives.

710
00:48:16,766 --> 00:48:18,866
That's very good of you.

711
00:48:24,435 --> 00:48:26,278
This is where he lived?

712
00:48:32,176 --> 00:48:33,849
And, where he died.

713
00:48:50,027 --> 00:48:53,099
Dear Theo and Jo,

714
00:48:57,134 --> 00:49:00,303
it is really very
beautiful here.

715
00:49:00,304 --> 00:49:02,580
I feel I see the
North all the better

716
00:49:02,581 --> 00:49:04,575
for my trip to the South.

717
00:49:06,143 --> 00:49:09,312
I have settled down
to some canvasses

718
00:49:09,313 --> 00:49:11,314
which I hope will go
some way lo recovering

719
00:49:11,315 --> 00:49:12,953
the pasts of my slay.

720
00:49:14,718 --> 00:49:16,629
Dr. Gachet is eccentric.

721
00:49:18,923 --> 00:49:20,664
I don't Know how he
thinks he can cure me

722
00:49:20,665 --> 00:49:24,461
when he seems at
least as sick as I am.

723
00:49:24,462 --> 00:49:26,635
However, I still
think that what I have

724
00:49:26,636 --> 00:49:30,467
is mostly a malady of the
South, and the the return here

725
00:49:30,468 --> 00:49:34,504
will be enough to
dissipate the whole thing.

726
00:49:34,505 --> 00:49:37,111
The thing is the days seem like,

727
00:49:42,012 --> 00:49:43,286
seem like weeks.

728
00:49:47,151 --> 00:49:50,153
The days seem like weeks to me.

729
00:49:50,154 --> 00:49:53,129
I'll be glad is sometime from
now you were lo come here

730
00:49:53,130 --> 00:49:54,966
one Sunday with your family.

731
00:49:54,967 --> 00:49:58,463
Very hardy handshakes,
your loving Vincent.

732
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:13,870
What the?

733
00:51:13,871 --> 00:51:14,941
Oy, come here!

734
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:20,574
Dear
father, I'm still waiting to see

735
00:52:20,575 --> 00:52:22,171
the doctor.

736
00:52:22,172 --> 00:52:23,810
I could've just given the
letter to the housekeeper

737
00:52:23,811 --> 00:52:27,610
or his daughter, but something
happened with Vincent

738
00:52:27,611 --> 00:52:29,512
in that house.

739
00:52:29,513 --> 00:52:31,014
I can tell.

740
00:52:31,015 --> 00:52:33,791
I want to ask the
doctor about it.

741
00:52:37,187 --> 00:52:39,428
I've decided to retrace
the path that Vincent took

742
00:52:39,429 --> 00:52:43,426
with his easel that Day
because what I've been told

743
00:52:43,427 --> 00:52:44,599
doesn't add up.

744
00:52:45,796 --> 00:52:48,675
And, strange things are
happening to me too,

745
00:52:48,676 --> 00:52:52,835
but don't worry, nothing
that I can't handle.

746
00:52:52,836 --> 00:52:55,772
People here are on
edge about Vincent,

747
00:52:55,773 --> 00:52:57,674
about what happened to him.

748
00:52:57,675 --> 00:53:00,343
Everyone has a different story.

749
00:53:00,344 --> 00:53:02,051
Tanguy, the paint
supplier, said that Vincent

750
00:53:02,052 --> 00:53:04,681
shot himself in the
fields, so does the girl

751
00:53:04,682 --> 00:53:05,683
from the inn.

752
00:53:07,217 --> 00:53:10,061
It seems a very long way
for him to have walked

753
00:53:10,062 --> 00:53:14,057
with a mortal would, and
I wonder if he wanted

754
00:53:14,058 --> 00:53:17,894
to kill himself, why didn't
He just pick up the gun

755
00:53:17,895 --> 00:53:19,465
and finish the job?

756
00:53:21,365 --> 00:53:23,174
Did he change his mind?

757
00:53:24,668 --> 00:53:27,080
Did he want to live after all?

758
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:39,819
No, I can see you.

759
00:53:44,388 --> 00:53:46,756
It was you last
night weren't it?

760
00:53:46,757 --> 00:53:47,861
Oh, not again.

761
00:54:16,053 --> 00:54:17,720
Can I help?

762
00:54:17,721 --> 00:54:19,359
If you could tell me where
to find a funny looking boy

763
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:23,029
with hair all over the place,
I want to ring his neck.

764
00:54:23,030 --> 00:54:25,094
Oh that'll be my nephew.

765
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:25,937
I'm sorry.

766
00:54:25,938 --> 00:54:27,066
He's a bit simple.

767
00:54:27,067 --> 00:54:28,941
Please don't pay him any mind.

768
00:54:28,942 --> 00:54:30,299
He's harmless.

769
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:33,603
He was following me
yesterday and today.

770
00:54:33,604 --> 00:54:35,438
That's not like him.

771
00:54:35,439 --> 00:54:37,076
Did you do something to him?

772
00:54:37,077 --> 00:54:38,951
No, I'm just delivering a letter

773
00:54:38,952 --> 00:54:42,044
for a friend of mine,
Vincent Van Gogh.

774
00:54:42,045 --> 00:54:45,151
The Painter fella, yeah
foreigner, red fellow.

775
00:54:45,152 --> 00:54:47,250
Yeah that's him.

776
00:54:47,251 --> 00:54:49,552
That'll be it then.

777
00:54:49,553 --> 00:54:51,430
That'll be what then?

778
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:54,291
Here cider'?

779
00:54:55,893 --> 00:54:58,661
Don't mind if I do.

780
00:54:58,662 --> 00:55:00,938
Thatching is thirsty work.

781
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:10,640
On the day that the
painter fellow was wounded,

782
00:55:10,641 --> 00:55:12,917
we heard a shot
coming from that barn.

783
00:55:16,747 --> 00:55:20,983
And, now my nephew, he
thinks it's haunted.

784
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:24,153
But, Vincent shot
himself in the fields.

785
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:26,489
That's what some folks say.

786
00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:31,093
But, I never met a person
who actually saw him there.

787
00:55:31,094 --> 00:55:35,364
The police looked for his
stuff, and they found nothing,

788
00:55:35,365 --> 00:55:39,602
not the gun nor his painting
stuff, nor his paintings.

789
00:55:39,603 --> 00:55:41,549
And, who'd steal
that sort of thing?

790
00:55:41,550 --> 00:55:45,611
So you think he shot
himself here in that barn?

791
00:55:47,878 --> 00:55:50,012
I'm not saying nothing.

792
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:52,181
We just heard a shot.

793
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:54,355
Well why didn't
you go in and look?

794
00:55:54,356 --> 00:55:59,055
It could've been anything,
kids shooting rats.

795
00:55:59,056 --> 00:56:01,002
No, it were only the
next day when I heard

796
00:56:01,003 --> 00:56:04,160
that he'd been shot
that I went and looked.

797
00:56:04,161 --> 00:56:05,862
And, there was nothing.

798
00:56:05,863 --> 00:56:09,003
Ii shot himself here, how
come you didn't see his stuff?

799
00:56:09,004 --> 00:56:11,033
That is the question.

800
00:56:11,034 --> 00:56:14,804
It's not that he was in a
state to move it himself,

801
00:56:14,805 --> 00:56:17,506
and why would
anyone else move it?

802
00:56:17,507 --> 00:56:19,578
Oh afternoon Mr. Roulin.

803
00:56:22,913 --> 00:56:27,416
How nice of you to save
me the trip to that place.

804
00:56:27,417 --> 00:56:31,024
Doctor sent me to tell you he
can see you tomorrow morning.

805
00:56:31,025 --> 00:56:32,588
Slop in at any time.

806
00:56:32,589 --> 00:56:35,328
Great, I was just
thinking what you said

807
00:56:35,329 --> 00:56:38,101
about Vincent laughing
around and drinking

808
00:56:38,102 --> 00:56:41,230
with those lads on
the day of his death.

809
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:42,369
Where was that?

810
00:56:43,667 --> 00:56:47,503
Well it was right
here, exactly here.

811
00:56:47,504 --> 00:56:50,280
Scribbling and scrawling
away he was as always.

812
00:56:50,281 --> 00:56:54,277
So he must've already
had the gun on him then?

813
00:56:54,278 --> 00:56:56,913
Yeah, I guess he must have.

814
00:56:56,914 --> 00:56:59,586
Well he might've had it
amongst his paintings.

815
00:56:59,587 --> 00:57:02,120
Wouldn't want to put
it on display would he?

816
00:57:02,121 --> 00:57:04,425
Where do you think
he got it from?

817
00:57:04,426 --> 00:57:07,300
Ravoux girl said Gachet
was a military man.

818
00:57:07,301 --> 00:57:09,225
Has a gun I guess.

819
00:57:09,226 --> 00:57:11,898
You think he could've
taken it from your place?

820
00:57:11,899 --> 00:57:13,965
- Not unless he
pill: it hack after.

821
00:57:13,966 --> 00:57:15,731
The doctor does have
a gun in his study,

822
00:57:15,732 --> 00:57:16,972
but I dust there
every afternoon.

823
00:57:16,973 --> 00:57:19,101
It's never been elsewhere.

824
00:57:19,102 --> 00:57:22,738
Anyway, everyone knows
it was old Ravoux's gun.

825
00:57:22,739 --> 00:57:25,942
He keeps it under the
counter, little pistol.

826
00:57:25,943 --> 00:57:27,944
And, it's not there anymore.

827
00:57:27,945 --> 00:57:29,788
Well, see you tomorrow.

828
00:57:43,493 --> 00:57:45,234
You were out early.

829
00:57:46,663 --> 00:57:47,663
Long day-

830
00:57:48,999 --> 00:57:49,999
Thirsty work.

831
00:57:54,071 --> 00:57:58,144
And, you've been quenching
that thirst I suppose.

832
00:58:01,111 --> 00:58:03,591
Today I heard mention
of young lads Vincent

833
00:58:03,592 --> 00:58:05,348
would hang around with.

834
00:58:05,349 --> 00:58:06,521
That would be the Sacretains,

835
00:58:06,522 --> 00:58:07,756
but you won't Find them here.

836
00:58:07,757 --> 00:58:09,452
They're in Paris.

837
00:58:09,453 --> 00:58:13,265
They would often joke around
with Vincent especially Rene.

838
00:58:18,362 --> 00:58:21,343
Rene could also take
it a little far.

839
00:58:28,839 --> 00:58:31,040
Poor Vincent, he nearly fainted.

840
00:58:31,041 --> 00:58:34,810
But, then Rene would buy
him a drink to apologize.

841
00:58:34,811 --> 00:58:37,052
He was like that always
picking up the tab,

842
00:58:37,053 --> 00:58:39,323
always buying people drinks.

843
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:45,721
I was also told that Vincent
got the gun from your place.

844
00:58:45,722 --> 00:58:46,722
What?

845
00:58:47,624 --> 00:58:49,625
Who told you that?

846
00:58:49,626 --> 00:58:51,293
We don't even have a gun.

847
00:58:51,294 --> 00:58:54,864
Gachefs housekeeper
told me you did.

848
00:58:54,865 --> 00:58:55,865
No.

849
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:59,908
Father used to own one
once, but he didn't reckon

850
00:58:59,909 --> 00:59:03,005
he'd need it here in
Auvers, so he sold it.

851
00:59:03,006 --> 00:59:04,713
Before Vincent was shot?

852
00:59:04,714 --> 00:59:06,042
Yes.

853
00:59:06,043 --> 00:59:08,080
We didn't have it
than, and don't you go

854
00:59:08,081 --> 00:59:11,150
spreading that
squawking hen's gossip.

855
00:59:15,185 --> 00:59:17,420
This came for you.

856
00:59:17,421 --> 00:59:20,197
It says that you've
lost your job.

857
00:59:21,725 --> 00:59:24,894
So you're not Good for credit.

858
00:59:24,895 --> 00:59:27,496
Room for one more at your fire?

859
00:59:27,497 --> 00:59:31,934
You look like
you've had a day of it.

860
00:59:31,935 --> 00:59:35,938
The Ravoux girl deprived
me of my roof for the night.

861
00:59:35,939 --> 00:59:37,885
Here that'll warm you.

862
00:59:45,615 --> 00:59:47,917
Now that's something different.

863
00:59:47,918 --> 00:59:49,192
My own recipe.

864
00:59:54,591 --> 00:59:57,297
So why did the Ravoux
girl get the hump'!

865
00:59:57,298 --> 00:59:59,934
Cause I said that maybe
Vincent got the gun from them.

866
00:59:59,935 --> 01:00:03,309
No, no old Ravoux
sold his gun lo Rene.

867
01:00:04,401 --> 01:00:06,202
Everyone knows that.

868
01:00:06,203 --> 01:00:08,942
He wanted it for a
stupid cowboy costume.

869
01:00:08,943 --> 01:00:11,647
He was running around
waving it in people's faces

870
01:00:11,648 --> 01:00:14,554
pretending he was
in the Wild West.

871
01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:20,653
Good customers, but bad sorts
especially the younger one.

872
01:00:24,621 --> 01:00:27,761
Vincent was being gentlemanly
towards the girls,

873
01:00:27,762 --> 01:00:32,094
and Rene barges in, "Girls,
don't Be bothering with him.

874
01:00:32,095 --> 01:00:34,563
"He cutoff his dick
as well as his ear."

875
01:00:34,564 --> 01:00:35,564
And, his ear.

876
01:00:38,969 --> 01:00:39,969
Let's go.

877
01:00:40,770 --> 01:00:42,340
These ones are mine.

878
01:00:43,306 --> 01:00:44,580
Gaston, come on.

879
01:00:48,578 --> 01:00:50,990
I'd have smacked the
run! If he said that to me.

880
01:00:50,991 --> 01:00:53,582
So why didn't you then?

881
01:00:53,583 --> 01:00:55,494
It wasn't my business.

882
01:00:57,254 --> 01:00:58,787
It wasn't my fight.

883
01:00:58,788 --> 01:01:01,624
So why didn't you
make it your fight?

884
01:01:01,625 --> 01:01:03,366
If I said what I
wanted to every lad,

885
01:01:03,367 --> 01:01:05,135
I'd have no customers.

886
01:01:10,834 --> 01:01:12,006
Won't you just.

887
01:01:14,171 --> 01:01:15,544
I could've used that.

888
01:01:15,545 --> 01:01:17,676
You could've said
something to the boys.

889
01:01:17,677 --> 01:01:19,710
Couldn't you see they
were bullying him?

890
01:01:19,711 --> 01:01:22,611
I told you Vincent
was hanging around them.

891
01:01:22,612 --> 01:01:24,214
If he didn't want to be
there, he could've stood up

892
01:01:24,215 --> 01:01:25,215
and left.

893
01:01:26,716 --> 01:01:30,986
Maybe he was there because
Rene always picked up the tab.

894
01:01:30,987 --> 01:01:33,693
Or, he just felt lonely and
liked being around young people

895
01:01:33,694 --> 01:01:35,361
who were enjoying themselves.

896
01:01:35,362 --> 01:01:36,701
How is it my business?

897
01:01:36,702 --> 01:01:38,468
No, you've had enough.

898
01:01:40,463 --> 01:01:43,966
Very friendly oi
you, turning your hack

899
01:01:43,967 --> 01:01:45,534
just like with Vincent.

900
01:01:45,535 --> 01:01:47,640
What did you do for him?

901
01:01:48,638 --> 01:01:51,340
I don't hear you
telling me that.

902
01:01:51,341 --> 01:01:53,685
Were you such a great friend?

903
01:01:55,378 --> 01:01:57,051
I never said I was.

904
01:02:05,488 --> 01:02:06,432
There you go.

905
01:02:06,433 --> 01:02:08,061
Thank you.

906
01:02:11,061 --> 01:02:12,261
Hiya.

907
01:02:12,262 --> 01:02:13,262
Who's he?

908
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:17,078
Who's he think he is?

909
01:02:17,079 --> 01:02:19,068
Probably some bloody gypsy.

910
01:02:19,069 --> 01:02:20,509
Seem like
a Nancy boy in that jacket.

911
01:02:22,706 --> 01:02:24,840
Who's he looking at?

912
01:02:24,841 --> 01:02:27,343
Head down, regular circus.

913
01:02:27,344 --> 01:02:28,544
Look who else is coming in.

914
01:02:28,545 --> 01:02:29,387
Where?

915
01:02:29,388 --> 01:02:30,879
Behind you.

916
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:32,715
Let's have some fun then.

917
01:02:32,716 --> 01:02:33,916
Are you coming?

918
01:02:37,854 --> 01:02:39,922
You are an idiot Sean.

919
01:02:39,923 --> 01:02:42,233
Who gave birth to that?

920
01:02:42,234 --> 01:02:44,760
Watch me nanny boy's coming.

921
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:46,866
What's he want then?

922
01:02:46,867 --> 01:02:48,364
. Hey Nancy boy.

923
01:02:48,365 --> 01:02:49,435
Maybe he wants to join me.

924
01:03:19,629 --> 01:03:20,629
My head.

925
01:03:35,412 --> 01:03:36,789
I didn't do that.

926
01:03:39,182 --> 01:03:42,186
No, it were me
that landed a punch.

927
01:03:43,753 --> 01:03:45,596
I don't remember.

928
01:03:48,024 --> 01:03:49,858
I think I was drunk.

929
01:03:50,927 --> 01:03:52,361
Oh you think.

930
01:03:52,362 --> 01:03:54,029
If I caused any damage-

931
01:03:54,030 --> 01:03:55,837
- You damaged the pride of
a couple of local laughs

932
01:03:55,838 --> 01:03:56,838
that's all.

933
01:03:58,368 --> 01:04:00,803
I hear you were
defending the honor

934
01:04:00,804 --> 01:04:02,477
of our village idiot.

935
01:04:05,108 --> 01:04:08,351
Yeah I think they
were picking on him.

936
01:04:09,779 --> 01:04:11,947
Well they paid their dues.

937
01:04:11,948 --> 01:04:14,783
But, you didn't
need to start on me

938
01:04:14,784 --> 01:04:16,819
when I arrived to
restore the peace.

939
01:04:16,820 --> 01:04:17,820
I'm sorry.

940
01:04:20,724 --> 01:04:22,533
You're the lad that was
asking about the Dutch guy

941
01:04:22,534 --> 01:04:24,159
that shot himself.

942
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:26,868
Yeah he's a friend of my dad's.

943
01:04:28,965 --> 01:04:31,800
You know my dad's a postmaster.

944
01:04:31,801 --> 01:04:34,338
Strange company
for a respectable man

945
01:04:34,339 --> 01:04:36,872
like a postmaster to keep.

946
01:04:36,873 --> 01:04:38,340
Not really.

947
01:04:38,341 --> 01:04:40,715
Vincent generated more
letters than a town,

948
01:04:40,716 --> 01:04:43,247
so it was sort of a
business relationship.

949
01:04:43,248 --> 01:04:46,415
So what business
do you have here'!

950
01:04:46,416 --> 01:04:48,417
I have an appointment
with Dr. Gachet

951
01:04:48,418 --> 01:04:50,986
to talk about Vincent.

952
01:04:50,987 --> 01:04:54,323
I had me eye on him
right from the start.

953
01:04:54,324 --> 01:04:56,759
Don't worry it'll be all right.

954
01:04:56,760 --> 01:04:59,027
I'll have a little look around.

955
01:04:59,028 --> 01:05:01,838
So when I come in on
Monday morning to hear

956
01:05:01,839 --> 01:05:04,900
he'd shot himself,
I'm not surprised.

957
01:05:04,901 --> 01:05:06,005
You're here.

958
01:05:07,103 --> 01:05:09,338
How is Mr. Vincent, any better?

959
01:05:09,339 --> 01:05:11,178
But, he told me
what I wanted to know.

960
01:05:11,179 --> 01:05:12,580
It's a bad do,
all this you know.

961
01:05:12,581 --> 01:05:14,178
That he tried to kill himself

962
01:05:14,179 --> 01:05:16,521
and not to let anyone
else gel the blame.

963
01:05:17,847 --> 01:05:20,589
Like I'd blame anyone
else for his crime.

964
01:05:22,452 --> 01:05:25,921
I think we should
leave the man in peace.

965
01:05:25,922 --> 01:05:28,528
Even caused me trouble
after he were dead.

966
01:05:28,529 --> 01:05:31,927
Dr. Mazery kept pestering
me to file his report

967
01:05:31,928 --> 01:05:35,197
even though he knew I
already had Gachefs.

968
01:05:35,198 --> 01:05:36,643
Who's Dr. Maury'?

969
01:05:43,306 --> 01:05:44,306
Dr. Malay?

970
01:05:45,208 --> 01:05:46,208
' Yes?

971
01:05:49,145 --> 01:05:51,880
I would never send
a report normally.

972
01:05:51,881 --> 01:05:53,949
I mean this was Gachefs case.

973
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:56,718
Then I read that the
patient died two days later

974
01:05:56,719 --> 01:05:57,719
in his room.

975
01:05:58,955 --> 01:06:01,936
So I felt that I
should for the record.

976
01:06:03,293 --> 01:06:06,595
I asked the patient
how it happened?

977
01:06:06,596 --> 01:06:08,630
He said he had shot himself.

978
01:06:08,631 --> 01:06:10,499
But, I knew he hadn't.

979
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:13,101
I could tell by his wound.

980
01:06:13,102 --> 01:06:14,803
With suicides, people
shoot themselves

981
01:06:14,804 --> 01:06:15,804
in the head.

982
01:06:17,407 --> 01:06:20,809
Either in the temple
or through the mouth.

983
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:24,485
If not, then through the heart,
but not through the stomach.

984
01:06:24,486 --> 01:06:25,824
I was suspicious.

985
01:06:27,083 --> 01:06:29,518
The bullet wound,
look, stand up.

986
01:06:29,519 --> 01:06:30,586
Stand up.

987
01:06:30,587 --> 01:06:31,690
Come on, let me show you.

988
01:06:31,691 --> 01:06:33,128
There you are back and forth.

989
01:06:33,129 --> 01:06:34,692
That's it, now back like that.

990
01:06:34,693 --> 01:06:36,525
Now you're down there like that,

991
01:06:36,526 --> 01:06:37,436
and now look.

992
01:06:37,437 --> 01:06:38,660
You see there.

993
01:06:38,661 --> 01:06:41,198
You see that's too low an angle.

994
01:06:43,666 --> 01:06:44,967
For what?

995
01:06:44,968 --> 01:06:45,968
He would've had to
have fired the gun

996
01:06:45,969 --> 01:06:48,036
with his outstretched toe.

997
01:06:48,037 --> 01:06:49,877
Go on you outstretch your toe.

998
01:06:49,878 --> 01:06:51,173
Just stretch your toe out.

999
01:06:51,174 --> 01:06:52,174
You see.

1000
01:06:54,110 --> 01:06:57,853
And, in any case if you fire
a bullet point blank range,

1001
01:06:57,854 --> 01:06:59,952
it'll go through the body.

1002
01:07:01,351 --> 01:07:04,195
Not always, but in
all probability.

1003
01:07:05,688 --> 01:07:08,557
So if it didn't go
through, then the gun

1004
01:07:08,558 --> 01:07:10,629
must've been further back.

1005
01:07:13,963 --> 01:07:15,306
Like there, bang!

1006
01:07:18,801 --> 01:07:19,801
You see?

1007
01:07:19,802 --> 01:07:20,802
I see.

1008
01:07:28,177 --> 01:07:30,248
Most likely he was shot.

1009
01:08:15,792 --> 01:08:18,794
If it isn't the
Provence pugilist.

1010
01:08:18,795 --> 01:08:20,362
Should I be scared?

1011
01:08:20,363 --> 01:08:23,065
I thought you didn't
go in for village gossip.

1012
01:08:23,066 --> 01:08:24,066
I don't.

1013
01:08:24,968 --> 01:08:26,948
That's why one employs servants.

1014
01:08:26,949 --> 01:08:29,037
They get it for you.

1015
01:08:29,038 --> 01:08:30,813
Did you also hear
that your friendly local

1016
01:08:30,814 --> 01:08:33,447
gendarme put me
up for the night?

1017
01:08:34,978 --> 01:08:39,051
So now you're up here
contemplating your future.

1018
01:08:40,550 --> 01:08:44,286
No actually I was
thinking how come you lied

1019
01:08:44,287 --> 01:08:47,089
if you've got nothing to hide?

1020
01:08:47,090 --> 01:08:49,297
What makes you
think I have and duty

1021
01:08:49,298 --> 01:08:51,067
to tell you the truth.

1022
01:08:52,562 --> 01:08:54,835
Maybe I just thought my life
was none of your business.

1023
01:08:54,836 --> 01:08:56,777
I wasn't asking about your life.

1024
01:08:56,778 --> 01:08:59,267
I was asking about
Vincent's death.

1025
01:08:59,268 --> 01:09:02,647
You thought that his death
and my life were linked?

1026
01:09:02,648 --> 01:09:05,745
Yes, bull don't
think that anymore.

1027
01:09:29,032 --> 01:09:31,774
The truth is I'm not important.

1028
01:09:35,038 --> 01:09:38,507
He wasn't some
lovelorn teenager.

1029
01:09:38,508 --> 01:09:39,508
I know.

1030
01:09:41,210 --> 01:09:43,690
Did you know he was a genius?

1031
01:09:46,149 --> 01:09:48,493
No, I can't Say that I did.

1032
01:09:52,455 --> 01:09:53,456
Well I did.

1033
01:10:08,571 --> 01:10:11,073
It's not finished yet.

1034
01:10:11,074 --> 01:10:12,883
Alright, I'll see it later.

1035
01:10:12,884 --> 01:10:14,650
Thank you.

1036
01:10:16,512 --> 01:10:17,388
Finished?

1037
01:10:17,389 --> 01:10:19,247
He's still working.

1038
01:10:19,248 --> 01:10:20,916
And, so did my father.

1039
01:10:20,917 --> 01:10:24,157
All his life he has tried
so hard to be an artist.

1040
01:10:24,158 --> 01:10:28,226
And, then this gruff awkward
man without any proper training

1041
01:10:30,593 --> 01:10:33,501
who'd only been painting a
few years comes barging in

1042
01:10:33,502 --> 01:10:36,170
and rushes off in a couple
of hours what poor father

1043
01:10:36,171 --> 01:10:39,738
couldn't dream of
painting in two lifetimes.

1044
01:10:41,237 --> 01:10:44,946
My dad would lock himself
away and copy them for hours.

1045
01:10:50,546 --> 01:10:52,547
Father told me I was
distracting Vincent

1046
01:10:52,548 --> 01:10:54,118
from important work.

1047
01:10:55,685 --> 01:10:58,188
Asked if I really
wanted to be responsible

1048
01:10:58,189 --> 01:11:01,760
for preventing masterpieces
from being born?

1049
01:11:02,725 --> 01:11:05,460
And, of course I didn't.

1050
01:11:05,461 --> 01:11:08,738
So I started lo not
be in or not he well

1051
01:11:10,466 --> 01:11:12,070
when Vincent called.

1052
01:11:16,906 --> 01:11:19,978
Soon after that,
they had an argument,

1053
01:11:21,611 --> 01:11:22,749
a terrible row.

1054
01:11:24,247 --> 01:11:27,456
It wasn't about me,
but maybe my withdrawal

1055
01:11:30,486 --> 01:11:31,931
had soured things.

1056
01:11:35,992 --> 01:11:37,972
The next time my father saw him,

1057
01:11:37,973 --> 01:11:40,304
he had a bullet in his belly.

1058
01:11:41,964 --> 01:11:43,739
Are you satisfied now?

1059
01:11:44,834 --> 01:11:46,177
You can blame me.

1060
01:11:47,336 --> 01:11:48,508
You can blame my father.

1061
01:11:48,509 --> 01:11:50,279
You're not to blame.

1062
01:11:51,674 --> 01:11:53,449
You've not part in it.

1063
01:11:56,612 --> 01:11:58,614
He was shot by some boys.

1064
01:11:59,916 --> 01:12:02,328
Some boy named Rene Sacretain.

1065
01:12:04,353 --> 01:12:05,353
I'm serious.

1066
01:12:06,689 --> 01:12:08,032
I can see that.

1067
01:12:09,525 --> 01:12:12,699
Rene': an idiot for sure,
but he's not a murderer.

1068
01:12:12,700 --> 01:12:15,630
An idiot who
drank, who had a gun,

1069
01:12:15,631 --> 01:12:17,167
who walked around
all summer with it

1070
01:12:17,168 --> 01:12:20,669
waving it in people's
faces, who bullied Vincent,

1071
01:12:20,670 --> 01:12:23,617
who was seen with Vincent
on the day of his death,

1072
01:12:23,618 --> 01:12:26,041
and his stuff disappears.

1073
01:12:26,042 --> 01:12:30,946
He didn't disappear it himself,
so there must have been

1074
01:12:30,947 --> 01:12:32,447
someone else.

1075
01:12:32,448 --> 01:12:33,688
It must've been.

1076
01:12:35,151 --> 01:12:36,960
So lonely Vincent
resorts to hanging around

1077
01:12:36,961 --> 01:12:40,332
with drunken teenagers,
and he gets shot.

1078
01:12:41,791 --> 01:12:45,705
Or, he shoots himself in
despair at his lonely life.

1079
01:12:47,897 --> 01:12:49,740
The result is the same.

1080
01:12:51,067 --> 01:12:54,014
Either way, instead
he could've been

1081
01:12:55,304 --> 01:12:59,207
at our place painting if
I'd behaved differently,

1082
01:12:59,208 --> 01:13:00,913
if him and my father
hadn't argued.

1083
01:13:00,914 --> 01:13:03,083
But, don't you care
that some bastard

1084
01:13:03,084 --> 01:13:05,753
may have gotten
away with murder?

1085
01:13:08,517 --> 01:13:12,053
You want to know so
much about his death,

1086
01:13:12,054 --> 01:13:14,762
but what do you
know of his life?

1087
01:13:16,058 --> 01:13:19,005
I know that he
tried hard to prove

1088
01:13:20,363 --> 01:13:22,434
he was good for something.

1089
01:13:24,767 --> 01:13:25,871
Yes, he did.

1090
01:13:30,106 --> 01:13:33,942
That's why Hake
flowers to his grave.

1091
01:13:33,943 --> 01:13:36,549
That's all I can do for him now.

1092
01:13:40,449 --> 01:13:44,753
He would appreciate the
delicate beauty of their bloom

1093
01:13:44,754 --> 01:13:47,860
even each blade of
their grassy stems.

1094
01:13:51,627 --> 01:13:55,734
No detail of life was too
small or too humble for him.

1095
01:13:59,602 --> 01:14:02,904
He appreciated and loved it all.

1096
01:14:30,833 --> 01:14:32,774
Let you out of jail did they?

1097
01:14:32,775 --> 01:14:35,339
On account of my
winning personality.

1098
01:14:35,340 --> 01:14:37,614
It's like trying to out
disgrace your friend Vincent.

1099
01:14:37,615 --> 01:14:39,176
I'm working on it.

1100
01:14:46,182 --> 01:14:49,026
You must be the young man
who's been waiting to see me.

1101
01:14:49,027 --> 01:14:50,618
Armand Roulin.

1102
01:14:50,619 --> 01:14:53,156
Son of the great Joseph
Roulin, giant of the South

1103
01:14:53,157 --> 01:14:55,457
with Dostoevsky': soul.

1104
01:14:55,458 --> 01:14:56,825
What?

1105
01:14:56,826 --> 01:14:58,631
That's what Vincent
called your father.

1106
01:14:58,632 --> 01:15:00,295
He told me all about him.

1107
01:15:00,296 --> 01:15:01,172
He did?

1108
01:15:01,173 --> 01:15:02,797
Yes, and your mother,

1109
01:15:02,798 --> 01:15:05,369
whose lullaby

1110
01:15:05,370 --> 01:15:09,170
could sooth even the souls
of Icelandic fisherman.

1111
01:15:09,171 --> 01:15:12,173
Come now, Armand of the
Roulin clan, take a seat,

1112
01:15:12,174 --> 01:15:13,174
be welcome.

1113
01:15:14,210 --> 01:15:15,777
Louise, drinks.

1114
01:15:15,778 --> 01:15:16,686
What'll you have, wine?

1115
01:15:16,687 --> 01:15:17,657
No, thank you.

1116
01:15:17,658 --> 01:15:19,182
I had my fill last night.

1117
01:15:19,183 --> 01:15:20,382
Ah, tea then.

1118
01:15:20,383 --> 01:15:22,150
I have just the recipe.

1119
01:15:22,151 --> 01:15:25,064
Louise, you know
the one, chop-chop.

1120
01:15:27,223 --> 01:15:28,964
So young man, I hear
you've been making

1121
01:15:28,965 --> 01:15:33,028
something oi a name for
yourself these past two days.

1122
01:15:33,029 --> 01:15:36,197
Believe me that
wasn't my intention.

1123
01:15:36,198 --> 01:15:38,733
I just wanted to
deliver a letter.

1124
01:15:38,734 --> 01:15:42,637
From a dead man lo a
dead man I understand.

1125
01:15:42,638 --> 01:15:46,408
Yeah, well I didn't
Know that when I set out.

1126
01:15:46,409 --> 01:15:47,979
A guy I met in Paris
thought you might have

1127
01:15:47,980 --> 01:15:50,712
the address for Theo's widow.

1128
01:15:50,713 --> 01:15:53,023
Seems right the family
should have the letter.

1129
01:15:53,024 --> 01:15:55,717
That's what my father reckons.

1130
01:15:55,718 --> 01:15:58,028
Your father sounds
like a responsible man.

1131
01:15:58,029 --> 01:15:59,554
I sympathize.

1132
01:15:59,555 --> 01:16:01,933
I have to look after the
health of great artists.

1133
01:16:01,934 --> 01:16:03,258
It is a burden.

1134
01:16:03,259 --> 01:16:05,226
They are not peaceful souls.

1135
01:16:05,227 --> 01:16:08,263
I understand because
I am an artist too.

1136
01:16:08,264 --> 01:16:10,598
That is why they trust me.

1137
01:16:10,599 --> 01:16:13,068
And, Vincent (rusted you too?

1138
01:16:13,069 --> 01:16:14,173
Yes, he did.

1139
01:16:16,772 --> 01:16:19,174
Does it mailer now?

1140
01:16:19,175 --> 01:16:22,110
I was hoping you'd tell ma.

1141
01:16:22,111 --> 01:16:24,245
Tell you what exactly?

1142
01:16:24,246 --> 01:16:27,222
Vincent wrote to my father
six weeks before he died,

1143
01:16:27,223 --> 01:16:29,253
and he said he fell
absolutely calm

1144
01:16:29,254 --> 01:16:31,553
and in a normal slate.

1145
01:16:31,554 --> 01:16:33,427
So I came here hoping
you could explain

1146
01:16:33,428 --> 01:16:36,591
how he went from absolutely
calm and in a normal state

1147
01:16:36,592 --> 01:16:37,592
to suicidal.

1148
01:16:39,528 --> 01:16:41,599
But, I reckon I know
the answer to that.

1149
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:43,064
Oh do you now?

1150
01:16:43,065 --> 01:16:46,101
You're familiar with
melancholia are you?

1151
01:16:46,102 --> 01:16:47,769
I wouldn't say so.

1152
01:16:47,770 --> 01:16:49,875
Sufferers can change
from feeling life

1153
01:16:49,876 --> 01:16:52,974
is a wondrous joy to
being stuck in a pit

1154
01:16:52,975 --> 01:16:55,977
of despair within six hours.

1155
01:16:55,978 --> 01:16:59,747
So think what changes are
possible within six weeks.

1156
01:16:59,748 --> 01:17:02,250
But, I don't reckon that's it.

1157
01:17:02,251 --> 01:17:04,786
Ravoux girl said
he was happy here.

1158
01:17:04,787 --> 01:17:08,490
She's obviously qualified
to make such a diagnosis.

1159
01:17:08,491 --> 01:17:10,801
She saw him everyday,
said he was calm

1160
01:17:10,802 --> 01:17:12,327
and seemed normal.

1161
01:17:12,328 --> 01:17:15,002
Maybe he did seem that
way, maybe he was that way

1162
01:17:15,003 --> 01:17:16,498
in the beginning.

1163
01:17:16,499 --> 01:17:17,409
There he is.

1164
01:17:17,410 --> 01:17:18,833
He's arrived.

1165
01:17:18,834 --> 01:17:20,643
Leaving the asylum had
given him fresh hope.

1166
01:17:20,644 --> 01:17:22,741
He didn't want for
much just his work

1167
01:17:22,742 --> 01:17:24,172
from day to day.

1168
01:17:24,173 --> 01:17:25,173
It's good to meet you.

1169
01:17:25,174 --> 01:17:26,243
Find a little friendship.

1170
01:17:26,244 --> 01:17:27,949
I've heard so much about you.

1171
01:17:27,950 --> 01:17:29,251
All will be well.

1172
01:17:30,479 --> 01:17:33,648
And, did he find
a little friendship?

1173
01:17:33,649 --> 01:17:35,984
He had it from me.

1174
01:17:35,985 --> 01:17:39,523
His friend Tanguy said
his star was finally rising.

1175
01:17:39,524 --> 01:17:41,122
And, it was.

1176
01:17:41,123 --> 01:17:44,659
With each new canvass, he
painted a shining star.

1177
01:17:44,660 --> 01:17:48,301
But, all of those stars were
surrounded by unfathomable,

1178
01:17:48,302 --> 01:17:50,131
empty loneliness.

1179
01:17:50,132 --> 01:17:53,170
You said he had your friendship
and his brother's love.

1180
01:17:53,171 --> 01:17:55,342
I mean it seems like
everything was all right.

1181
01:17:55,343 --> 01:17:59,340
Underneath he was deeply
afraid of the future.

1182
01:17:59,341 --> 01:18:00,675
To the baby, yes.

1183
01:18:00,676 --> 01:18:02,451
Of his own and Theo's.

1184
01:18:05,014 --> 01:18:08,291
Time to meet you little boy.

1185
01:18:13,889 --> 01:18:17,492
I don't think he's
responding to your medicine.

1186
01:18:17,493 --> 01:18:19,564
He knew that Theo had spent

1187
01:18:19,565 --> 01:18:21,405
a small fortune on him.

1188
01:18:25,668 --> 01:18:28,911
The knowledge oi this
tore into Vincent.

1189
01:18:30,673 --> 01:18:31,673
Excuse me.

1190
01:18:34,310 --> 01:18:35,983
Theo could've
had a house like this

1191
01:18:35,984 --> 01:18:38,982
with all the money he'd spent
on Vincent over the years.

1192
01:18:38,983 --> 01:18:43,718
But, instead what did he have
for his new wife and baby'!

1193
01:18:43,719 --> 01:18:47,826
Rooms full of paintings
that no one wanted to buy.

1194
01:18:55,164 --> 01:18:58,566
Vincent's biggest fear
was that the burden of him

1195
01:18:58,567 --> 01:19:00,945
would bring down his brother.

1196
01:19:05,374 --> 01:19:07,547
So Vincent worried
a little about money.

1197
01:19:07,548 --> 01:19:11,079
It's not like they
were starving is it?

1198
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:14,584
Listen I don't reckon
he committed suicide.

1199
01:19:16,685 --> 01:19:18,620
I reckon he was shot.

1200
01:19:19,888 --> 01:19:22,195
Have you been talking to Mazery?

1201
01:19:22,196 --> 01:19:24,569
You heard his tale of how
the angle of the bullet

1202
01:19:24,570 --> 01:19:28,863
was all wrong, that nobody shoots
themselves in the stomach?

1203
01:19:28,864 --> 01:19:30,565
Well yeah.

1204
01:19:30,566 --> 01:19:33,935
What's to stop Vincent from
doing something improbable?

1205
01:19:33,936 --> 01:19:35,745
I mean cutting a piece of
your ear off and making

1206
01:19:35,746 --> 01:19:38,742
a present of it to a whore
is hardly probable now is it?

1207
01:19:38,743 --> 01:19:40,777
But, there was this
lad Rene who had a gun,

1208
01:19:40,778 --> 01:19:43,150
who bullied Vincent and was
seen with him on that day.

1209
01:19:43,151 --> 01:19:45,817
I was at Vincent's
bedside on that day,

1210
01:19:45,818 --> 01:19:48,316
and he said he had shot
himself and told me

1211
01:19:48,317 --> 01:19:49,951
not to blame anyone.

1212
01:19:49,952 --> 01:19:51,219
Not to blame anyone?

1213
01:19:51,220 --> 01:19:52,722
Doesn't that sound
to you like he was

1214
01:19:52,723 --> 01:19:53,995
trying to cover for someone?

1215
01:19:53,996 --> 01:19:56,257
He wanted to die I know that.

1216
01:19:56,258 --> 01:19:57,996
Why would he say
there's no one to blame

1217
01:19:57,997 --> 01:19:59,973
unless he thought
someone might be blamed?

1218
01:19:59,974 --> 01:20:03,671
He said that because
there was someone, me.

1219
01:20:04,633 --> 01:20:05,633
I think he

1220
01:20:08,570 --> 01:20:11,312
took his life to
try and save Theo

1221
01:20:14,143 --> 01:20:16,589
because of something I'd said.

1222
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:22,483
You see there was an
argument, and I said

1223
01:20:22,484 --> 01:20:24,655
something to Vincent
that as his doctor

1224
01:20:24,656 --> 01:20:26,098
I should never have said.

1225
01:20:26,099 --> 01:20:28,356
But, he'd made me so angry.

1226
01:20:28,357 --> 01:20:29,824
You know nothing about art!

1227
01:20:29,825 --> 01:20:31,270
He called me an artistic fraud.

1228
01:20:31,271 --> 01:20:32,637
And, you are lying
especially lo yourself.

1229
01:20:32,661 --> 01:20:33,661
In a way I am.

1230
01:20:33,662 --> 01:20:35,296
You are an artistic fraud.

1231
01:20:35,297 --> 01:20:36,833
I desperately wanted
to be an artist,

1232
01:20:36,834 --> 01:20:38,368
but my father made
me study medicine,

1233
01:20:38,369 --> 01:20:40,802
and I failed to stand up to him.

1234
01:20:40,803 --> 01:20:44,172
Vincent said I was living
a lie whilst he lived

1235
01:20:44,173 --> 01:20:47,208
and struggled for the truth.

1236
01:20:47,209 --> 01:20:50,622
So I thought in the heat of
our argument, okay Vincent

1237
01:20:50,623 --> 01:20:53,981
I'll give you your
precious truth.

1238
01:20:53,982 --> 01:20:57,725
I knew that Theo was in the
tertiary stages of syphilis,

1239
01:20:57,726 --> 01:21:00,988
any stress financial,
emotional or physical

1240
01:21:00,989 --> 01:21:02,127
could kill him.

1241
01:21:06,362 --> 01:21:09,330
I said to Vincent,
"What do you think

1242
01:21:09,331 --> 01:21:11,004
"the burden of
worrying about you

1243
01:21:11,005 --> 01:21:13,034
"is doing to your brother?"

1244
01:21:13,035 --> 01:21:15,336
It's quite likely killing him.

1245
01:21:15,337 --> 01:21:17,510
That is the price of
your truth, the price

1246
01:21:17,511 --> 01:21:19,540
of your path as an artist.

1247
01:21:19,541 --> 01:21:20,747
Is it worth it?

1248
01:21:21,744 --> 01:21:24,247
That stopped the argument dead.

1249
01:21:26,415 --> 01:21:27,415
Vincent?

1250
01:21:29,351 --> 01:21:30,351
Vincent!

1251
01:21:32,154 --> 01:21:33,565
Vincent come back!

1252
01:21:35,758 --> 01:21:36,758
Vincent!

1253
01:21:39,495 --> 01:21:43,170
Two weeks later, I am
sitting at his bedside,

1254
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:45,874
and he is dying.

1255
01:21:47,903 --> 01:21:52,774
The only words he said, "Maybe
it is better for everyone."

1256
01:23:14,356 --> 01:23:16,529
Here a letter for a letter.

1257
01:23:18,126 --> 01:23:21,005
Theo's widow is collecting
all his letters.

1258
01:23:21,006 --> 01:23:22,763
She wants to publish them.

1259
01:23:22,764 --> 01:23:25,040
I'll make sure she gets that.

1260
01:23:39,815 --> 01:23:41,726
In reading through
Vincent's letters to Theo,

1261
01:23:41,727 --> 01:23:43,851
she came across this one.

1262
01:23:43,852 --> 01:23:45,991
It moved her so much,
she copied it out

1263
01:23:45,992 --> 01:23:47,399
and sent it to me.

1264
01:23:50,626 --> 01:23:52,827
Why are you giving it to me?

1265
01:23:52,828 --> 01:23:54,171
It is from when
he was starting out

1266
01:23:54,172 --> 01:23:56,998
on his journey as an artist.

1267
01:23:56,999 --> 01:23:58,979
Take it for your journey.

1268
01:24:04,840 --> 01:24:07,542
Thank you Dr. Gachet.

1269
01:24:07,543 --> 01:24:10,752
Armand Roulin, good luck.

1270
01:24:19,721 --> 01:24:20,855
Thanks a lot.

1271
01:24:20,856 --> 01:24:22,690
No bother sir.

1272
01:24:30,766 --> 01:24:34,873
Who am
I in the eyes of most people?

1273
01:24:36,171 --> 01:24:39,846
A nobody, a non entity,
an unpleasant person.

1274
01:24:43,245 --> 01:24:46,948
Someone who has not,
and never will have

1275
01:24:46,949 --> 01:24:49,450
any position in society.

1276
01:24:49,451 --> 01:24:52,057
In short, the lowest of the low.

1277
01:24:56,458 --> 01:25:00,406
Well then even if that
were all absolutely true,

1278
01:25:02,631 --> 01:25:06,135
then one day I will
have to show by my work

1279
01:25:07,703 --> 01:25:11,310
what this nobody, this non
entity has in his heart.

1280
01:25:25,887 --> 01:25:28,889
I looked for you at the bar.

1281
01:25:28,890 --> 01:25:30,961
Any luck on the job from?

1282
01:25:33,095 --> 01:25:34,095
Nothing.

1283
01:25:35,564 --> 01:25:38,067
Lieutenant Milliet
says I should enlist.

1284
01:25:38,068 --> 01:25:39,467
What for?

1285
01:25:39,468 --> 01:25:42,574
Well I'm good at
fighting, aren't I?

1286
01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:48,609
Roulin's have always been that.

1287
01:25:48,610 --> 01:25:52,353
The trick is to know
what you're fighting for.

1288
01:25:55,117 --> 01:25:57,084
Would you look at it?

1289
01:25:57,085 --> 01:26:00,032
There's a whole
other world up there.

1290
01:26:01,590 --> 01:26:05,367
Something we get to gaze upon
but don't fully understand.

1291
01:26:07,262 --> 01:26:08,832
It reminds me of him.

1292
01:26:12,100 --> 01:26:15,343
It feels wrong all
that life snuffed out

1293
01:26:16,338 --> 01:26:18,682
because of a stupid accident.

1294
01:26:20,475 --> 01:26:25,312
I'm still wondering why he
would cover for those boys.

1295
01:26:25,313 --> 01:26:26,986
What I'm wondering is if people

1296
01:26:26,987 --> 01:26:29,223
will appreciate what he did.

1297
01:26:36,491 --> 01:26:38,402
You were looking for me?

1298
01:26:40,328 --> 01:26:44,065
This arrived from
Holland this morning.

1299
01:26:44,066 --> 01:26:46,239
It's from Jo, Theo's widow.

1300
01:26:47,836 --> 01:26:51,045
It turns out Gachel
did send the letter.

1301
01:26:54,309 --> 01:26:58,052
And, she was terribly
touched by what you did.

1302
01:26:59,514 --> 01:27:01,015
She thought it only right
that you should know

1303
01:27:01,016 --> 01:27:05,152
what was in it, so she
copied it out for us.

1304
01:27:05,153 --> 01:27:08,322
She sends her, she
said something about-

1305
01:27:08,323 --> 01:27:10,234
- Alright, give it here.

1306
01:27:16,364 --> 01:27:19,038
In the life of the painter,

1307
01:27:19,039 --> 01:27:22,903
death may perhaps not be
the most difficult thing.

1308
01:27:22,904 --> 01:27:27,775
For myself, I declare I
don't Know anything about it.

1309
01:27:27,776 --> 01:27:32,513
But, the sight of the stars
always makes me dream.

1310
01:27:32,514 --> 01:27:35,552
Why I say to myself should
those spots of light

1311
01:27:35,553 --> 01:27:38,919
in the firmament bet
Inaccessible lo us?

1312
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:42,094
Maybe we can take
death to go to a star

1313
01:27:43,592 --> 01:27:46,227
and lo die peacefully of
old age would be to go there

1314
01:27:46,228 --> 01:27:47,228
on foot.

1315
01:27:49,765 --> 01:27:51,938
For the moment, I'm
going to go to bed

1316
01:27:51,939 --> 01:27:56,937
because it's late, and I wish
you goodnight and good luck

1317
01:27:56,938 --> 01:28:00,044
with a handshake,
your loving Vincent.
